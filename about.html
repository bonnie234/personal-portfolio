        <p>Growing up in rural Wisconsin, my childhood days were filled with projects and adventures. Many hours were spent with animals or in the garden. But when indoors, I was sitting at my desk drawing and writing. It was sheer determination to which I tried to draw a horse in perfect proportion. Often I would come up with story and illustrate the pictures to go with it.

        <p>I wasn’t sure of my major when I started college. However, one of my favorite things to do was to reconstruct my old clothes into new clothes. It was opportunity to improve upon a design, once the previous no longer fit my needs. This hobbie propelled me to the textile design program. I followed the program from the University of Wisconsin to the Fashion Institute of Design in New York City and from there started my 8-9 year career developing fabric color and patterns for women’s apparel.

        <p>In NYC, I gravitated towards the many art experiences the city has to offer. Exhibits, curated stores, musical performances and travel allowed me to understand how others artistically organize information and create a story or mood. I continued this exploration online and found many websites and social media sites which conveyed the brand identities. This lead me to taking continuing education courses in online marketing and branding.

       <p>But is was discovering user experience design brought many of these things together. Learning UX/UI design and relocating to Chicago has been a great opportunity to expand my skills and thought process around development. I continue to examine successful interactions and strengthen knowledge of web applications.

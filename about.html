      <div class="about1">
        <p>Growing up in rural Wisconsin, my <mark>childhood days</mark> were filled with projects and adventures. Many hours were spent with animals or in the garden. But when indoors, <b>I was sitting at my desk drawing and writing.</b> It was sheer determination to which I tried to draw a horse in perfect proportion. Often I would come up with story and illustrate the pictures to go with it.

      <div class="about2">
        <p>I wasn’t sure of my major when I started college. However, one of my favorite things to do was to reconstruct my old clothes into new clothes. It was opportunity to improve upon a design, once the previous no longer fit my needs. This hobbie propelled me to the <b>textile design program.</b> I followed the program from the <mark>University of Wisconsin to the Fashion Institute of Design in New York City</mark> and from there started my 9 year career developing fabric color and patterns for women’s apparel.

      <div class="about3">
        <p>In <mark>NYC</mark>, I gravitated towards the many <b>art experiences</b> the city has to offer. Exhibits, curated stores, musical performances and travel allowed me to understand how others artistically organize information and create a story or mood, as well as overall trends. I continued this exploration online and found many websites and social media sites which conveyed the brand identities. This lead me to taking continuing education courses in <b>online marketing and branding.</b>

     <div class="about4">
       <p>But is was discovering <b>user experience design brought many of these things together.</b> Learning UX/UI design and relocating to <mark>Chicago</mark> has been a great opportunity to expand my skills and thought process around development. I continue to examine successful interactions and strengthen knowledge of web applications.

      <div class="about1">
        <p>Growing up in rural Wisconsin, my childhood days were filled with projects and adventures. Many hours were spent running around with animals or helping in the garden. But in my free time, I was sitting at my desk drawing and writing. It was sheer determination to which I tried to draw a horse in perfect proportion. I’m not sure I had an immediate inclination for artistry, but I accessed every available resource to practice. Often I would come up with story and illustrate the pictures to go with it. Pencil and eraser marks (cluttered the page) until I got it up to an acceptable standard to present to my family and classmates.

        <p>I strayed from visual arts in high school and I wasn’t sure of my major when I started college. (major was undeclared) However, one of my favorite things to do was to reconstruct my clothes into new clothes. It was opportunity to improve upon a design, once the previous no longer fit my needs. As well as a creative outlet that required a bit of vision mixed with some organic natural results. This hobbie lead me to the textile design program, compelling a future career in fashion. I followed the program from the University of Wisconsin to the Fashion Institute of Design in New York City and from there started my 9 year career developing fabric color and patterns for women’s apparel.

        <p>In NYC, I gravitated towards the many art experiences the city has to offer. Exhibits, curated store, musical performances and travel allowed me to understand how others artistically organize information and create a story or mood. This, in addition to following fashion trends, allowed me to begin to see the development of ideas on a larger scale. I continued this exploration online and found many websites and social media sites which conveyed the brand identities. This lead me to taking continuing education courses in online marketing and branding. Discovering user experience design brought many of these interests together. While I appreciate learning to strengthen my artistic vision through fashion, I often missed the analytical side of development.

       <p>Learning UX design and relocating to Chicago has been a great opportunity to expand my skills and thought process around development. I continue to examine successful interactions and strengthen knowledge of web applications. </p>
